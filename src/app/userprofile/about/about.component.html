    Picasa Web Albums (PWA) was an image hosting and sharing web service
    from Google, often compared to Flickr and similar sites. The service
    links with Google's photo organizing desktop program Picasa. It was
    discontinued in May 2016 and succeeded by Google Photos. It allowed
    users with a Google account to store and share photos with an initial
    free storage offering of 15 GB, that is shared with Gmail and Google
    Drive. Storage was unlimited for photos of resolution less than
    2048x2048 pixels for Google+ users, and for photos of resolution less
    than 800x800 for everyone else. Videos shorter than 15 minutes also
    don't count towards the limit. Once the storage is full, uploaded photos
    are automatically resized to fit the resolution for unlimited storage.
